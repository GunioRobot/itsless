It's Less
=========

[It's Learning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_learning) is a learning
management system with a needlessly complex user interface.

*It's Less* is a user script for the Firefox extension Greasemonkey (it may also
work with other user script engines, though this has not been tested), aiming
to improve this interface.


Installation
------------

* [itsless.user.js](https://github.com/fohlin/itsless/raw/master/itsless.user.js)
  is the user script.
* See the [Greasemonkey wiki](http://wiki.greasespot.net/Greasemonkey_Manual:Installing_Scripts)
  for detailed installation instructions.
